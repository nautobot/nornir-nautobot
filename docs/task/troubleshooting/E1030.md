# E1030 Details

## Message emitted:

`E1030`: Discovered `% Permission denied for the role` in the output

## Description:

Common permission issue, primarily (and potentially exclusively) seen on Cisco NXOS.

## Troubleshooting:

This is generally seen on Cisco NXOS devices. Ensure user is allowed to run the command that is being requested.

## Recommendation:

Ensure that the actual command that is ran, is allowed for the user making the connection. As an example, if `show run` is allowed, but `show running-config` is not, would need to address that.
