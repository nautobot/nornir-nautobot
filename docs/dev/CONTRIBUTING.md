# Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple versions of Python through GitHub Actions. 

Except for unit tests, testing is only supported on Python 3.9.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `Docker` to help with the local development of the project and to run tests within GitHub Actions.

The project is following Network to Code software development guidelines and is leveraging the following:

- Python linting and formatting: `pylint` and `ruff`.
- YAML linting is done with `yamllint`.

Documentation is built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The [Docker based development environment](dev_environment.md#docker-development-environment) can be started by running `invoke docs` [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) that auto-refreshes when you make any changes to your local files.

## Creating Changelog Fragments

All pull requests to `next` or `develop` must include a changelog fragment file in the `./changes` directory. To create a fragment, use your GitHub issue number and fragment type as the filename. For example, `2362.added`. Valid fragment types are `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `fixed`, `removed`, and `security`. The change summary is added to the file in plain text. Change summaries should be complete sentences, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period, and be in past tense. Each line of the change fragment will generate a single change entry in the release notes. Use multiple lines in the same file if your change needs to generate multiple release notes in the same category. If the change needs to create multiple entries in separate categories, create multiple files.

!!! example

    **Wrong**
    ```plaintext title="changes/1234.fixed"
    fix critical bug in documentation
    ```

    **Right**
    ```plaintext title="changes/1234.fixed"
    Fixed critical bug in documentation.
    ```

!!! example "Multiple Entry Example"

    This will generate 2 entries in the `fixed` category and one entry in the `changed` category.

    ```plaintext title="changes/1234.fixed"
    Fixed critical bug in documentation.
    Fixed release notes generation.
    ```

    ```plaintext title="changes/1234.changed"
    Changed release notes generation.
    ```

## Branching Policy

The branching policy includes the following tenets:

- The develop branch is the primary branch to develop off of.
- If there is a reason to have a patch version, the maintainers may use cherry-picking strategy.
- PRs intended to add new features should be sourced from the develop branch.
- PRs intended to address bug fixes and security patches should be sourced from the develop branch.
- PRs intended to add new features that break backward compatibility should be discussed before a PR is created.

Nornir-Nautobot will observe semantic versioning, as of 1.0. This may result in an quick turn around in minor versions to keep pace with an ever growing feature set.

## Release Policy

Nornir-Nautobot has currently no intended scheduled release schedule, and will release new features in minor versions.

When a new release is created the following should happen.

- A release PR is created with:
    - Update to the changelog in `docs/admin/release_notes/version_<major>.<minor>.md` file to reflect the changes.
    - Change the version from `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-beta` to `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` in pyproject.toml.
    - Set the PR to the main
- Ensure the tests for the PR pass.
- Merge the PR.
- Create a new tag:
    - The tag should be in the form of `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
    - The title should be in the form of `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
    - The description should be the changes that were added to the `version_<major>.<minor>.md` document.
- If merged into `main`, then push from `main` to `develop`, in order to retain the merge commit created when the PR was merged
- A post release PR is created with.
    - Change the version from `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` to `<major>.<minor>.<patch + 1>-beta` pyproject.toml.
    - Set the PR to the `develop`.
    - Once tests pass, merge.
