## Overview

* Providing a Nornir inventory that leverages Nautobot's API.
* A set of opinionated Nornir plugins.

The set of plugins intend to provide mechanisms to include common networking workflows that will help enable network automation. As an example, there are method to get configurations or test network connectivity. Over time this will include functions to perform actions such as get vlans, neighbors, protocols, etc.
